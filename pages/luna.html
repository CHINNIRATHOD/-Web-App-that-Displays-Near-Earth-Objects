            The Moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth and the fifth largest
            largest of the solar system. Its name comes from the Latin "moon" which
            means "light", in its archaic form it was "leuksna" and later
            "louksna". The union of "leuks" (light) and the suffix -na means
            luminous
          </p>
          <p>
            Since ancient times, the Moon has fascinated humanity and has been
            object of study and observation by various cultures.

            <li>
              The duration of both periods is the same due to a phenomenon
              known as &quot;Tidal Couplings&quot; which
              slows down the rotational movement of the moon. Throughout the
              time, this process has caused the rotation of the Moon to coincide
              with its orbital period around the Earth, which means
              who always shows the same face towards us.

          <h2>CURIOSITIES</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The average distance between the Moon and Earth is
              approximately 384,400 km. On the moon there is no wind or sound. HE
              I could say that more people have arrived on the Moon than on the
              depths of the oceans. <br />
              Every year the Moon moves 3.8 centimeters away from the Earth.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Moon formed about 4.5 billion years ago and has
              evolved over time due to geological activity
              and erosion. It is composed mainly of igneous rocks, such as
              basalt and anorthosite, and also contains elements such as iron,
              titanium and helium-3.
            </li>
            <li>
              Moon phases and influence on the Earth &rarr; The Moon shows
              different phases as it moves around the Earth. The
              Full moon occurs when the Moon is on the opposite side of the
              Earth to the Sun and the new Moon occurs when the Moon is between the
              Earth and the Sun. It has a series of effects on the Earth,
              including tides and stabilization of the Earth's axis.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Moon has been the subject of several space missions, including

                from the United States and more recent missions from China and others
                countries. It has been proposed that the Moon could be colonized in the
                future due to its proximity to Earth and its resources
                potentials, such as water and minerals.
